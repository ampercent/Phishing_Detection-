Phishing Detection: Your All-in-One Protection Tool üõ°Ô∏è
Phishing Detection is a powerful web application that uses AI to protect you from phishing attacks. It offers a suite of tools to detect and analyze potential threats from emails, QR codes, and URLs, so you can stay safe online.

Features
Email Phishing Detection: Our AI-powered email analyzer uses a Logistic Regression model and TF-IDF Vectorizer to achieve a 98% accuracy in detecting phishing emails. It provides a real-time confidence score and highlights suspicious language and other red flags.

QR Code Scanning: Scan QR codes in real-time with your device's camera or upload an image to analyze the embedded URL. Our scanner is mobile-friendly and supports a wide range of QR code formats.

Manual URL Detection: Paste any URL into our analyzer to get an instant security assessment. We use multiple APIs, including Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal, to provide a comprehensive analysis of the URL's safety.

How It Works
Phishing Detection's multi-layered security approach ensures that you are protected from all angles. Here's a breakdown of our detection process:

AI-Powered Analysis: Our machine learning model is trained on a massive dataset of phishing emails, allowing it to recognize and flag even the most sophisticated attacks.

Multi-API Integration: We use a combination of security APIs to cross-reference URLs and identify known threats.

Heuristic Analysis: Our system analyzes URL patterns, domain age, and SSL certificates to detect suspicious activity.
